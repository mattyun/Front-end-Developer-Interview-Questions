#Front-end Job Interview Questions

This file contains a number of front-end interview questions that can be used when vetting potential candidates. It is by no means recommended to use every single question here on the same candidate (that would take hours). Choosing a few items from this list should help you vet the intended skills you require.

**Note:** Keep in mind that many of these questions are open-ended and could lead to interesting discussions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would.

#### JS Questions:

* Explain event delegation
  * Answer: Event delegation refers to the process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future.
* Explain how `this` works in JavaScript
  * Answer: 'this' refers to the context of the currently executing method. i.e. the object the currently executing method is a part of. Usually just the object to the left of the dot in a method invocation. Also the first argument when you use call, apply, or bind. 
* Explain how prototypal inheritance works
  * Answer: When every instance of a class has an internal prototype pointer to the prototype of the class. Different ways to create the class:
    * Prototypal - create an object using Object.create and passing in the class's prototype object
    * Pseudoclassical - just use 'this'. Creating an instance using 'new' will basically assign the prototype pointer of 'this' to its class's prototype object.
* What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
  * Modularity is great. AMD is commonly used in the front end (e.g. RequireJS) because its async and CommonJS on the backend (Node). ES6 export/import is becoming the new standard - compact like CommonJS and async like AMD. 
* Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`.
  * What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
  * Answer: You can't immediately invoke a declaration. Wrap it in () to indicate to the parser that it's an expression. 
* What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared?
  * How would you go about checking for any of these states?
  * Answer: null is a value you assign to a variable to represent 'no value', undefined is the type of a variable that has been declared but not yet defined, and undeclared variables have not been declared. typeof null is 'object' and typeof undefined is 'undefined' 
  * http://lucybain.com/blog/2014/null-undefined-undeclared/
* What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
  * When a function object has access to the execution context of the outer function it was created in, even after the outer function has returned. Commonly used to create private variables. 
* What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
  * Answer: http://lucybain.com/blog/2014/js-anonymous-referenced-declared-functions/
* How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
  * Answer: Prototypal inheritance. React - modular patterns using ES6
* What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
  * Answer: host objects are inherent to the environment (e.g. 'window') whereas native objects are inherent to the language 
* Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?
* What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`?
* Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.
* When would you use `document.write()`?
  * Answer: Never - if it runs after the doc has loaded it'll overwrite everything
  * Alternatives - innerhtml()
* What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?
  * http://lucybain.com/blog/2014/feature-detection-vs-inference/

* Make this work:
```javascript
duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]

* Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?
